# Premier-League-Match-Predictor

This project focuses on predicting Premier League match outcomes by combining web-scraped match statistics with a custom machine learning pipeline. The core objective is to model and forecast match results using both contextual and performance-based features.

The main goals were:
  Collect: Scrape and compile two seasons of Premier League match data (2022â€“2024), including advanced shooting stats and contextual info.
  Transform: Clean, merge, and structure the raw data into a unified, match-level dataset.
  Predict: Apply a machine learning pipeline to forecast match results based on historical and performance-based features.
  Output: Generate interpretable predictions for downstream use or analysis.

The pipeline emphasizes automation, reproducibility, and practical sports analytics.
