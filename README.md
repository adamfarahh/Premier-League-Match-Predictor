## üß† Premier League Match Outcome Prediction

This project focuses on predicting Premier League match outcomes by combining **web-scraped match statistics** with a custom **machine learning pipeline**. The core objective is to model and forecast results using both **contextual** and **performance-based** features.

### üéØ Objectives

* **Collect**
  Scrape and compile two seasons of Premier League match data (2022‚Äì2024), including advanced shooting statistics and contextual metadata.

* **Transform**
  Clean, merge, and structure the raw data into a unified, match-level dataset ready for modeling.

* **Predict**
  Apply a machine learning pipeline to forecast match outcomes based on historical trends and performance metrics.

* **Output**
  Generate interpretable predictions for downstream use, analysis, or validation.
