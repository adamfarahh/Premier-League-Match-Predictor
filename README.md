## Premier League Match Outcome Prediction

This project focuses on predicting Premier League match outcomes by combining **web-scraped match statistics** with a custom **machine learning pipeline**. The core objective is to model and forecast results using both **contextual** and **performance-based** features.

### Objectives
* **Collect**
  Scrape and compile two seasons of Premier League match data (2022â€“2024), including advanced shooting statistics and contextual metadata.
* **Transform**
  Clean, merge, and structure the raw data into a unified, match-level dataset ready for modeling.
* **Predict**
  Apply a machine learning pipeline to forecast match outcomes based on historical trends and performance metrics.
* **Output**
  Generate interpretable predictions for downstream use, analysis, or validation.

### Focus

This pipeline emphasizes: **Automation**, **Reproducibility**, **Practical Sports Analytics**
